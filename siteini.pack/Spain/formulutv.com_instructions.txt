This siteini gives you only a correct schedule when used on Linux or on Windows via cygwin.
(Although I have not tested Win 10.  This migth work correctly)
The problem is the command window not being utf-8 compatible.  (In win 10 this should be solved)


Windows:
You will need curl for Windows:  https://curl.haxx.se/windows/

Download it, and copy the files from the bin folder to the WG++ working folder.
This is the folder containing the Webgrab++.config.xml file


Linux:
Install curl with: 

sudo apt install curl

give the command:

cp -s -u /usr/bin/curl /your_WG++_work_folder/curl.exe

This makes a symlink to the curl utitlity
