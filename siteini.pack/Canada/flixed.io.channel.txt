Works for both Canada as the US.

But in order to create channellists you need curl:

Windows:

You will need curl for Windows: https://curl.haxx.se/windows/  

Download it, and copy the files from the bin folder to the WG++ working folder.  (Or the SitiIni folder)

This is the folder containing the Webgrab++.config.xml file    

Linux: Install curl with:  

sudo apt install curl  

give the command:  

cp -s -u /usr/bin/curl /your_WG++_work_folder/curl.exe

use your_WG++_work_folder, or the folder containing the SiteIni

This makes a symlink to the curl utitlity

For just running the programme curl is not needed.
The channellist are created for one city, containing all the providers for that city.
The channellists can be combined.
