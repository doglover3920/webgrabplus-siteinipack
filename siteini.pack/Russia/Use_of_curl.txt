Windows:
You will need curl for Windows:  https://curl.haxx.se/windows/

Download it, and copy the files from the bin folder to the WG++ working folder.
This is the folder containing the Webgrab++.config.xml file


Linux:
Install curl with: 

sudo apt install curl

give the command:

cp -s -u /usr/bin/curl /your_WG++_work_folder/curl.exe

This makes a symlink to the curl utitlity
