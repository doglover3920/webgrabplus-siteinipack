For some SiteIni's curl is needed.

Windows:
You will need curl for Windows:  https://curl.haxx.se/windows/

Download it, and copy the files from the bin folder to the WG++ folder containing the SiteIni used.

Linux:
Install curl with: 

sudo apt install curl

give the command:

cp -s -u /usr/bin/curl /your_WG++_work_folder/curl.exe

The folder "your_WG++_work_folder" is the WG++ folder containing the SiteIni used.  
Full path.  

This makes a symlink to the curl utitlity
